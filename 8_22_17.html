    <h1>Shoe Bot - 8/22/2017</h1>
        <p>This video is of one of the most successful tests we have had of the car. In this program we used several new features we have developed since the last post I made. Most importantly, this program uses a proportional algorithm to control the steering of the robot. One of the only problems we had with the proportional algorithm was the tuning of the proportional constant as it was difficult to quickly change this value. We were able to solve this problem by developing a second version of our control software. Our new control system is based around the Node.js system and allows us to control the car though a webpage. This webpage has sliders for quickly adjusting important variables in the software, and allows us to see live updates of the results of these changes. The scanse lidar manufacturers had also written a Node javascript library that allowed us to quickly port our python algorithms into full javascript.</p>
        <p>Another important change we made was the way the car detected walls. We found that pointing the sensor at the ground allowed us to find gaps when the wall was not there. We then averaged the size of the gap to find where the car should go. When the car drove up to a wall, the gap would dissapear on one side causing the average to shift and the car to follow the shifted gap, avoiding the wall. Rather than trying to just avoid walls as our previous algorithm had done, we now follow gaps that the lidar detects, allowing the car to react and adjust more quickly.</p>
