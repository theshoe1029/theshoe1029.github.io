    <h1>Shoe Bot - 8/22/2017</h1>
        <p>This is a simple program that I wrote to buy shoes that are in high demand. The program uses a python selenium library to fully automate the purchasing of shoes on the adidas website, with the goal being to buy yeezys when they are first released. Yeezys have a high resale value, however they sell out in seconds so the only way to purchase them is to use a bot like this one. My bot uses a user generation script from the <a href="https://github.com/kfichter/OpenATC">OpenATC</a> project. The user generation script allows a user to enter their personal information for the program to use. Initially I was going to try to hide the bot's continuous requests using a tor proxy, however the adidas site was able to quickly detect the proxy and block me from accessing it. Additionally, I discovered that the yeezy purchase page requires a captha to be solved, which this program is currently unable to do.</p>
